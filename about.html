    Hi, I'm Samprita! I have had myopia most of my life, meaning that my eyesight worsened so rapidly that I had to get a new pair of glasses every year. Later on, I went on Ortho-k treatment, which is basically stunting the vision decline of my eyes. I realized that without the financial support, there was no way I could have even lived life the way I have. It seems that up to billions are living in a blurry world, in unimaginable circumstances that are interrupting their daily lives. I strive for a change, because this issue doesn't seem to be talked about as much, yet it is a very serious one. I hope that this motivates you to help the unprivileged as well.
